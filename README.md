# MyPA

MyPA is a student-led project by students from Singapore Management University for the module SMT203 Smart City Management & Systems. 
It features a telegram bot, that helps students to manage their project meetings, tasks and major deadlines through reminders. It also boasts a 'common time' feature, where the bot can returns common available timings of project group members by uploading each members' timetables.  

On top of building a telegram bot MyPA, we have also published a <a href="https://medium.com/@chris.jt.tan/the-humble-beginnings-of-mypa-d0db4637859b">Medium article</a> to document our journey.
